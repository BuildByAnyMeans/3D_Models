# 🛠️ Assorted 3D Models for Fabrication & Printing

Welcome to my collection of 3D models, shared for fellow makers, builders, and digital fabrication enthusiasts. This repository includes a variety of designs in **F3D** (Fusion 360) and **STL** formats, suitable for **3D printing**, **woodworking**, and **metal fabrication**. Many models also come with **PDF build instructions** for easier assembly and workshop use.
