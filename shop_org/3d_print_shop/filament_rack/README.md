# 🧵 Parametric Wood Filament Rack

This project includes everything you need to build a **clean, durable, all-wood filament spool rack**, perfect for makers who want a solid, no-nonsense storage solution. Forget printing a bunch of brackets — this design is fully wood-based, easy to build, and customizable.

## 📁 Included Files

- **`Filament_Rack_Wood_Final.f3d`** – A fully parametric Fusion 360 model. Adjust spacing, size, and layout to match your spools and shop setup.
- **`Filament_Rack_Wood_Final.pdf`** – Printable step-by-step build instructions based on the creator's real-world build, with measurements, diagrams, and a materials list.

## 🪵 Why Go All Wood?

Most filament rack designs still require wood somewhere — rails, bases, mounts. So why waste time printing half the solution? This design **skips the printed parts** and gives you a clean, strong wooden build from the start. It's quicker, more rigid, and just looks better in a shop setting.

**Bonus:** You also **save print time and filament** for things that really need it!

## ✏️ Customization

The `.f3d` file is completely parametric:
- Change the number of spools or rack width
- Adjust hole sizes or slot angles
- Fit different materials or wall mount needs

Just open it in Fusion 360, tweak the parameters, and you’re ready to cut and build.
